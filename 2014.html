<h1>2014</h1>
</div>
<p>2014 has been a packed year for me which has been full of variety and changes. </p>

<p>The year started with my growing distaste for college. Part of the challenge was the seemingly slow pace of the course I had chosen - a Level 3 BTEC in IT and Computing. This left me wanting more, while struggling to justify the mundane tasks that would help me 'learn' to topics. After listening to a talk by <a href="http://twitter.com/danrubin">Dan Rubin</a> in February called 'Why we do what we do', on what motivates and drives us, I decided that I would look for something else to do other than college. I wanted to work with other developers.</p>

<p><a href="http://rewiredstate.org">Rewired State</a> posted a job listing for two internships at the end of that month, which I decided to go for. I started my internship at the end of February along with Gideon, and I aided in the delivery of projects under the wing of Julia. More than anything, it helped me understand what I am particulary strong at and, in turn, where I could improve. </p>

<p>I aided in the delivery of A/V at the Festival of Code 2014, while chatting to many young people about Rewired State, and generally being on-hand to help. It was the first event of it's scale where I had been on the organising side and it was knackering. I worked alongside the Rewired State and <a href="http://yrs.io">Young Rewired State</a> teams to ensure the event was a success.</p>

<p>I then ended my internship to work full-time across both Rewired State and Young Rewired State, taking care of Developer Relations and Community. It has been hard work for everyone, but we're in an awesome place and the coming months will have some great new projects. I'm proud to be a part of the team.</p>

<p><strong>Other Notable Things</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ran a code club for primary school students to teach them how to build websites. </li>
  <li>Ran a fitness night for my old Scouting group (the irony)</li>
  <li>Was part of a discussion about the data.parliament platform as a Rewired State developer, and then saw it progress as a member of staff. </li>
  <li>Was a centre lead for National Hack the Government down in Exeter. There I met one of my very good friends <a href="http://twitter.com/nekiniee">James</a>. </li>
  <li>Took part in the Hacker Olympics and had a great time with <a href="http://twitter.com/nekiniee">James</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/JacKCooney">Jack</a> and Robert. </li>
  <li>Walked a full 26-mile marathon with <a href="http://twitter.com/angisolar">Angi</a> and Nazita, which I will not be doing again. </li>
  <li>Learnt how to use Rails and Meteor.js with some degree of proficiency. </li>
  <li>Been going out with Sophia, my girlfriend, for a year.</li>
  <li>Moved to Birmingham, with the kind support of <a href="http://twitter.com/gabysslave">Julia</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/exsanguinator">Nat</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/IAmGabyHHHHHHHH">Gaby</a>.</li>
  <li>Went to The Hague to run an event (also learnt where The Hague was and how to spell it).</li>
  <li>Got to work alongside <a href="http://twitter.com/nickmhalliday">Nick</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/greentrac">Tracy</a>, who were there back in 2011 when I had decided that I wanted to be a developer.</li>
  <li>Worked on camera with <a href="http://twitter.com/rebeluncut">Rebel Uncut</a>. It was pretty awesome and I hope I get to do it again soon. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I need to get better at</strong></p>

<p>I need to slow down; I jump around many topics in my mind, and somehow expect others to do the same. I also need to speak slower and focus on doing one thing at a time.</p>

<p>My communication skills need to improve; I need to be clear about my capacity to complete tasks and ask for help when I need it. I have great friends who are willing to help, and I shouldn't be afraid to ask them for it.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I'd like to improve my health next year. Most of what I do comprises of sitting down all day, I snack on high-sugar crap, and exercise is a foriegn concept to me. I want to change that.</p>

<hr />

<p>It's been an amazing year, and here's to the next! I have done a lot this year, with the support of my friends, and I hope you all remain happy and healthy throughout 2015!</p>
